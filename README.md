# calendar-project
## Note: I removed the credentials to connect to the database to practice proper safety.
* This is a final project for CSC340 (Software Engineering and Ethics) I created using the waterfall method. The end result is a personal calendar that is capable of adding, editing,
and removing events. The program is also capable of listing all events at a glance as well as in detail. 
* I have not looked heavy at the code in about 2 years so some bugs may apply.
